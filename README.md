# 8-bit CPU
This project is a demonstration of how a barebones, but turing complete, 8-bit CPU works at the logic gate/register level, demonstrated using [Logisim](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution). This project was motivated by [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/@BenEater) and the [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU) produced by him where he builds an 8-bit CPU on breadboards.
